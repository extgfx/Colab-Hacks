Inti semua ini:

## [Colab RDP](Colab%20RDP/Colab%20RDP.ipynb) &nbsp;&nbsp; [![Open in Colab][Colab Badge]][RDP Notebook] [![RDP Issues][RDP Issues]](https://github.com/extgfx/Colab-Hacks/issues/labels/Colab%20RDP)

Lu bakal bisa dapetin **Remote Connection** ke Google Colaboratory dan lu bisa pake se enak jidat.

Torrent Downloader is **Colab based Torrent Downloader** in which you doesn't need any torrent client only just a google account for downloading and storing downloaded torrents into google drive. It doesn't utilizes your internet for download and for any reason the download remains incomplete then you can resume it in other colab instance. Just Download from your drive if needed.

 > **Catatan :** Lu bisa download file apapun terus simpen di Google Drive pake command `wget <link>` terus pindah ke folder `/content/drive/My\ Drive/`

<br />

## Warning: Not for Cryptocurrency Mining
> **Why are hardware resources such as T4 GPUs not available to me?**
The best available hardware is prioritized for users who use Colaboratory interactively rather than for long-running computations. Users who use Colaboratory for long-running computations may be temporarily restricted in the type of hardware made available to them, and/or the duration that the hardware can be used for. We encourage users with high computational needs to use Colaboratoryâ€™s UI with a local runtime.
Please note that using Colaboratory for cryptocurrency mining is disallowed entirely, and may result in being banned from using Colab altogether.
